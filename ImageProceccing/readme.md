# Mid Term
## Lab-1: Color Space Conversion
Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:
- a) Read an image.
- b) Display the image resolution in the format: Resolution = Width × Height pixels.
- c) Print the image color mode.
- d) Convert the image into grayscale.
- e) Display both the original image and the grayscale image.
- f) Label each displayed image with an appropriate title.
- g) Save the grayscale image.
## Lab-2: Brightness adjustment of grayscale images
Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:
- a) Read a grayscale image.
- b) Increase the brightness of the image by multiplying each pixel value by a scaling factor S₁ = 1.5
- c) Decrease the brightness of the image by multiplying each pixel value by a scaling factor S₂ = 0.3
- d) Compare the original grayscale image with the brightness-adjusted images.

## Lab-3: Image Thresholding
Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:
- a) Read a grayscale image
- b) Set a threshold value, k = 128
- c) Apply binary thresholding using:
if r > k → s = 255
else → s = 0
- d) Display the binary image
- e) Create three binary images using different thresholds: k = 50, 100, 150
- f) Compare the results
## Lab-4: Image Negative Transformation
Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:
- a) Read a grayscale image
- b) Apply image negative transformation using the formula:  s = 255 – r
- c) Display both images
